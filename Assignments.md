# ðŸ“˜ Assignment #1: Drafting Pre-Analysis Plans (PAP)

**Instructions:**  
In your small groups, think of a **research question** you would like to study. Then, come up with a corresponding **intervention** and draft a **Pre-Analysis Plan (PAP)**.

You can:
- Use one of the example topics provided in class  
- Or choose your own research idea

Use the `PAP_outline.md` file as a guide to structure your PAP draft.

You will **present your ideas on Tuesday after lunch**. Presentations can be done with or without slides â€” feel free to share your ideas vocally if preferred.

**Material:**  
ðŸ“„ `PAP_outline.md`

# ðŸ“˜ Assignment #2: Estimating Impacts

**Instructions:**  
Using the **same groups** as for the PAP, select **one or two outcomes** to estimate. We will work step-by-step through the following estimation strategies:

- Intent-to-Treat (ITT)  
- ANCOVA  
- Difference-in-Differences (DiD)  
- LATE (Local Average Treatment Effect)  
- Lee Bounds (for attrition correction)

**Material:**

## ðŸ§­ Outline for Your Presentation

1. **Research Question & Outcomes**
   - What are you studying?
   - Which outcome variable(s) are you focusing on?
   - How can these be measured (e.g., survey questions or indicators)?

2. **Impact Estimation**
   - What does your **ITT estimate** suggest?
   - How does the **effect size** change using **ANCOVA**?
   - What about **DiD**?
   - What are the **advantages and disadvantages** of each method?

3. **Non-Compliance**
   - What % of participants did **not comply** with treatment?
   - How do you handle this?
   - What does the **LATE estimate** tell us?

4. **Attrition**
   - How many participants **missed the endline survey**?
   - Is attrition **differential across treatment groups**?
   - What do the **Lee bounds** tell us about robustness?
